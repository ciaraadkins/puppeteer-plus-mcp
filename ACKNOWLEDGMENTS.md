## Project Inspiration

**Puppeteer+ MarTech** (puppeteer-plus-martech) is an experimental implementation inspired by and building upon **@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer**. While it shares the same foundational architecture and core capabilities, this project extends the original with specialized tools focused on digital marketing analytics and technology detection.

The official puppeteer server by Anthropic (available at [https://www.pulsemcp.com/servers/modelcontextprotocol-puppeteer](https://www.pulsemcp.com/servers/modelcontextprotocol-puppeteer)) provides the robust foundation upon which this enhanced version is built.

## Key Enhancements

This project adds specialized capabilities for digital marketing professionals and analytics engineers:

- **Marketing Technology Detection**: Comprehensive scanning of websites to identify marketing tools, analytics platforms, advertising pixels, and tag management systems
- **Adobe Analytics Tools**: Specialized tools for Adobe Experience Cloud technology detection and analysis
- **Network Request Analysis**: Deep inspection of marketing beacons and tracking requests
- **Visual Highlighting**: Screenshot capabilities with overlay markers for marketing technologies
- **SEO Analysis**: Extended tools for metadata examination and structured data assessment

## Technical Attribution

The core architecture, including the MCP server implementation, browser management, and basic Puppeteer integration, builds upon the design patterns established by the original project. All enhancements and extensions were developed specifically for digital marketing use cases while maintaining compatibility with the original API structure.

## License Notice

This project is released under the MIT License, the same as the original project that inspired it. All contributions and enhancements are provided in the spirit of collaboration and with full acknowledgment of the foundational work by Anthropic.
